# QA Report — paymentSchedule

This file is the durable QA record for the project. Each QA pass appends a new
dated section (most recent first). Format per entry: **Summary → Test cases →
Issues found → Recommendations**. See `CLAUDE.md` (Phase 3: QA) for the workflow.

## 2026-07-21 — Full test-suite execution (unit + integration + E2E)

### Summary

Executed all three test layers. Unit and integration suites were green on the
first run. The E2E suite surfaced **one pre-existing test defect** (not a product
bug), which was fixed; the suite is now fully green.

### Test cases run

- **Unit** (`npm test`): 27/27 passed (2 files).
- **Integration** (`npm run test:integration`): 13/13 passed (2 files) — purchase lifecycle + overdue/dashboard/cascade flows.
- **E2E** (`npm run test:e2e`): 16/16 passed after the fix below (initially 15/16).

### Issues found

1. **E2E locator ambiguity — `new purchase: auto-split installments and sum-mismatch validation`** (test defect, fixed).
   - **Symptom:** Playwright strict-mode violation — `getByRole('button', { name: 'Nouvel achat' })` resolved to 2 elements.
   - **Root cause:** the `/achats` page shows two legitimate "Nouvel achat" buttons — a permanent one in the sidebar (`AppSidebar.vue`) and one in the Achats view. The app is correct; the test's locator was under-scoped. Pre-existing (its failure screenshot was already present at session start), not a regression from relocating `e2e/` → `docs/e2e/`.
   - **Fix:** scoped the click to the main region — `page.getByRole("main").getByRole("button", { name: "Nouvel achat" })` in `tests/e2e/run.mjs`.
   - **Reproduce (before fix):** `npm run test:e2e` → the named test fails on the button click.

No product defects found.

### Recommendations

- Wire `npm test`, `npm run test:integration`, and `npm run test:e2e` into CI (in that order) so the E2E stage runs headless on each PR.
- Consider a shared helper for "open the new-purchase modal" so future callers can't re-introduce the ambiguous-locator class of bug.

## 2026-07-21 — Integration test suite for the api/backend flows

### Summary

Added an opt-in **integration** test layer that sits between the fast unit tests
(`src/**`) and the browser E2E suite (`tests/e2e/run.mjs`). The new suites drive
the real `api` facade (`src/api/index.ts`) against the in-memory backend
(`src/api/mock.ts`) across multi-command flows, verifying that the api → mockDb →
finance layers stay consistent with one another. The E2E directory was also
relocated from `e2e/` to `docs/e2e/`, and the delivery workflow now mandates
maintaining this report.

Each integration test re-seeds a fresh backend (via `vi.resetModules()`), so the
6-client / 8-purchase seed is identical and isolated per case.

### Test cases — written, NOT run (awaiting confirmation)

Per the QA workflow, integration tests are not executed automatically. Run them
with `npm run test:integration`.

`tests/integration/purchase-lifecycle.integration.test.ts`
- Auto-split of a total across installments matches `splitAmounts` (1000/3 → 333/333/334) and starts fully `pending`.
- Caller-supplied uneven split is honoured when the amounts sum to the total.
- Explicit split whose amounts don't sum to the total is rejected (`SUM_MISMATCH`).
- Installment status transitions pending → partial → paid; purchase moves pending → in_progress.
- Purchase flips to `paid` once every installment is settled; payment ledger totals reconcile.
- Non-positive payment amount is rejected (`INVALID_AMOUNT`).
- Creating a purchase and paying it bumps the dashboard's purchase/sales/collected/outstanding aggregates correctly.

`tests/integration/overdue-dashboard.integration.test.ts`
- Dashboard aggregates reconcile with `listImpayes`, `listClients`, `listPurchases`, `listAllPayments` on the seed.
- `ImpayeFilter` by `clientId` narrows to one client and preserves that client's installments.
- Impossible date window yields an empty overdue list.
- Paying an overdue installment in full removes it from impayés and decrements the dashboard overdue count.
- Unforced delete of a client with purchases is refused (`CLIENT_HAS_PURCHASES:n`) and mutates nothing.
- Forced delete cascades: client, its purchases, and its overdue rows disappear; dashboard purchase count updates.

### Issues found

None — this pass added coverage; no product defects were surfaced (tests not yet executed).

### Recommendations

- Execute `npm run test:integration` to confirm the suites pass, then wire both `npm test` and `npm run test:integration` into CI ahead of the Playwright E2E stage.
- Consider a component-level integration layer (mounting filterable list views with Pinia + i18n) if UI-wiring regressions become a concern; current integration coverage stops at the api facade.
